 ## Global Books Garden
A global bookstore website where users can order books based on their currency. This application also allows admin accounts to add and edit items to the stores. The external API will translate the DB’s currency to the User’s frontend, and whenever the user orders the items the currency of the order will be translated back to US. <br> 

## Requirements
## User Customer:
•	Register. <br> 
•	Login/Logout. <br> 
•	Can see the book items listed the application. <br> 
•	Can change the currency of the item listings via external API. A minimum of 3 different currencies are planned. <br> 
•	User can update their profile, and order information. <br> 
•	When customer submits their order, the order’s status is automatically set to pending status until other user types come in to either approve or reject it. Customer can see the updated status on their end. <br> 
•	User can request to cancel the order approve process. <br>  
•	Can see order in native currency for invoice. (Use External API to validate the currency exchange) <br> 
## User Admin:
•	update, approve and reject customer’s orders. <br>  
•	Add, update and delete listings of the books. <br> 
•	can see the customer’s orders in USD amount and the native amount. <br> 
## Stretch goals:
•	Admin can add image files instead of just URL image files to item listings. <br> 
•	Users can see books based on categories <br>  
•	Book API. <br>
